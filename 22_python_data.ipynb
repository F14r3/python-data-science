    "**However**, it is important to appreciate the difference between using this method and the state-based interface. The state-based interface refers to the \"current\" plot, which is whatever is created from the most recent use of the `.plot()` command (as long as this isn't saved into a variable). In contrast, the Pandas example above creates a plot object first (`thisplot`), and the subsequent commands use an object-oriented interface to refer to this object specifically. This means that certain commands differ between the two. For example, to set the x-axis label you use the `.xlabel()` method for the state-based interface, but the `.set_xlabel()` method for the object-oriented interface."
